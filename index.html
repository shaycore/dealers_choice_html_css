                <h2>The Story of Shimcheong</h2>
                <p><i>There are many versions of the Tale of Shimcheong, but this well-known Korean folk tale follows generally the same story beats. This example will pull from one of many interpretations of this folk tale.</i></p>
                <p>Long, long ago, there was a poor family that lived in the Peach Blossom Village. After the death of his wife, Blind Man Sim was the single father of his young daughter, Sim Cheong.</p>
                <p>A Buddhist Monk told Blind Man Sim that by offering 300 bags of rice to Buddha, he would be able to see again.</p>
                <p>However, he does not have the necessary amount. To pay for the bags, Sim Cheong sacrifices herself to Sea Merchants, who throw her into the water as a sacrifice to the Indang Sea.</p>
                <p>What meets her after she throws herself into the stormy sea is not death, but the Jade Emperor, who takes her to the Dragon Palace of the Dragon King.</p>
                <p>Eventually, she is sent back to the surface inside of a lotus flower, only to be seen by the Chinese Emperor of the Song Dynasty, who decides to take her as his wife.</p>
                <p>As an Empress, Sim Cheong holds a feast for the blind and is able to reunite with her father, who is overjoyed and thus regains his eyesight.</p>
